- 👋 Hi, I’m @RecruiterMeagan
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with people to learn more about their specialties and preferences in their career. I can help with pretty much anything career related you can think of. What the market is looking like, resume feedback, interview prep, opportunities at the moment. I'm here to provide value to anyone while learning more about development myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate GitHub :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone!
- 📫 How to reach me mtunley@aplin.com or call/text 403-351-2456
